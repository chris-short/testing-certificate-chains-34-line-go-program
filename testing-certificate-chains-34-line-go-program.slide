* Three Go Packages: log
- The Go `log` package is pretty self explanatory
- It's the package that enables logging
- There should be a spectacular failure at the sign of trouble
- `log` has three helper functions: `print`, `fatal`, and `panic`
- Output from the package goes to `stderr`
- I used a `fatal` error to get the web server to stop and log any issue

* Three Go Packages: crypto/tls
- The Go `crypto/tls` package partially implements TLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 5246
- This is the package that configures SSL/TLS versions that can be used
- Identifies preferred cipher suites and elliptic curves used during handshakes
- This is the package that handles connections securely

* Three Go Packages: net/http
- Go web server is the `net/http` package
- Go implementation of HTTP
- `net/http` has a function called `ListenAndServeTLS`
- ListenAndServeTLS provides the desired certificate checking functionality
- "If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation of the server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate."
